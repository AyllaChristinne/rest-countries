## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - For styles
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io) - For tests

### What I learned


With this project, I was able to reinforce concepts of the life cycle of React components and the use cases of each hook (especially useEffect). Furthermore, for the first time I configured ESLint and Jest from scratch in a project, and got to know and use the Mock Service Worker.

A topic that I already knew, but that I delved deeper into with this project, was the BEM pattern and the Context API. For the first time, too, I made a theme switcher from scratch.

### Continued development

What I want to continue focusing on in future projects is web accessibility and the different types of tests that can be done.
